# Rigorous Critique

Systematically identify problems in a design before implementing it, focusing on unnecessary complexity, missing fundamentals, and feasibility.

Three lenses:
1. **Unnecessary Complexity** -- What can we delete without losing value?
2. **Missing Fundamentals** -- Are we building polish before platform? (Level 0 before Level 2)
3. **Feasibility and Value** -- Is the juice worth the squeeze?

Good critique cuts 30-50% of proposed features, identifies 3+ Level 0 gaps, finds "delete this package" opportunities, and results in a clearer v2 plan. Every critique comes with a proposed alternative.
