# Complete Developer Experience

Developer Experience requires three components in balance: Tools, Documentation (ontology), and Agents.

The DX Triad: Remove any leg and the stool falls over. Tools without docs = technically correct but unusable. Docs without tools = theory. Agents without tools = code that doesn't run.

Hierarchy of needs (bottom up): Predictable, Debuggable, Productive, Delightful. Common mistake: starting at the top before solving the bottom.

Minimum viable DX: Tools + Documentation = Usable (ship day zero). Tools + Documentation + Agents = Lovable (add agents within 30-90 days).
