# Socratic Requirements Discovery

Use progressively revealing questions to build consensus and illustrate why changes are needed, rather than stating requirements directly.

7-step progression: Empathy (understand current state), Tension (reveal gaps), Exposure (show environment differences), Challenge (question complexity), Comparison (show better ways), Evaluation (open to change), Value (articulate vision).

Key principles: Questions not answers, concrete over abstract, build from simple to complex, use real scenarios, allow discovery. Success: stakeholders say "we need to fix this" before you propose a solution.
