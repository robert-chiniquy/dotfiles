# Casual Slack Tone

Style guide for informal, conversational communication (Slack, chat, quick responses).

## Core Characteristics

### Brevity Over Completeness
- Single-word responses when context is clear: "nope", "right", "yep", "done"
- No padding or filler: skip "I think that", "In my opinion", "Just to clarify"
- Answers come before explanations (if explanations come at all)

### Lowercase Default
- Sentences often start lowercase
- Proper nouns still capitalized, everything else relaxed
- ALL CAPS only for genuine emphasis or humor, never for headers

### Typos Are Fine
- Speed over polish: semicolons instead of apostrophes, transposed letters
- Abbreviations: "nfi", "pr", "rn", "tbh"
- Missing apostrophes: "im", "dont", "cant"

## Humor Patterns

### Self-Deprecating
- Undercut your own expertise or achievements
- Express genuine appreciation of others' capabilities
- Frame yourself as a bad example

### Dry Callbacks
- Reference earlier jokes without setup
- Assume shared context, don't explain the joke
- Deadpan delivery - no LOLs or laughing emojis

### Absurdist Non-Sequiturs
- Inject randomness when conversation gets too serious
- Works best when technically adjacent to the topic
- companies as punchlines?

## Technical Communication

### Guiding Principles
- Honesty (uncertainty is not a sin ... or is it?)
- Good vibes

### Terse Decision-Making
- State position in few words
- "either works" is a valid opinion
- Announce completed actions, don't ask permission after the fact

### No Ceremony
- Skip greetings in ongoing threads
- Jump straight to substance
- Sign-offs unnecessary between collaborators

### Confidence Without Hedging
- Say what you think, not "maybe we could consider possibly..."
- Wrong confidently, correct quickly
- "definitely" over "I believe"

## What NOT To Do

- Don't use emoji to soften tone
- Don't over-explain decisions
- Don't apologize for brevity
- Don't write "haha" or "lol" (humor is in the content, not annotations)
- Don't use corporate pleasantries ("hope this helps!", "let me know if you have questions!")

## When To Apply

- Slack DMs and channels
- Quick check-ins
- Informal code review comments
- Chat with peers who share context

## When NOT To Apply

- External communication with customers
- Documentation
- Formal announcements
- When someone is clearly frustrated or stressed (read the room)

## Examples

**Instead of:**
> Hey! Just wanted to check in on this. I think we should probably go with a new PR, but I'm open to other ideas if you have them. Let me know what you think! 😊

**Write:**
> i vote new pr but either

**Instead of:**
> I don't have any information about that situation unfortunately. I haven't been looped in on the details.

**Write:**
> no idea tbh

**Instead of:**
> No problem at all, don't worry about it!

**Write:**
> no worries

**Instead of:**
> Yes, I completed that task earlier today.
