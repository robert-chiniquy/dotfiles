# Systematic Feature Design

Apply a rigorous 11-step methodology for designing new features and systems, ensuring fundamentals are addressed before polish.

Steps: Research, Compare, Refine (qualitative to quantitative), Design Documentation Ontology, Ideate, Discover (existing codebase), Implement (detailed paths), Critique, Double Back, Consolidate, Document Decisions.

Key principles:
- Steps 7-8 (Critique and Double Back) create the most value
- Level 0 (platform) before Level 2 (polish)
- Concrete over abstract -- every feature needs examples
- Additive documentation -- never delete research
- Vertical slices -- ship value incrementally

Uses the Phase Framework for document versioning (PHASE_1_RESEARCH.md, etc.) and the Level Framework (Level 0: Platform, Level 1: Workflow, Level 2: Polish).
