# Technical Writing Voice

Style guide for long-form technical content: blog posts, deep dives, architecture explanations, conference talks. The voice of someone who reads textbooks on weekends and can't believe this stuff actually works.

Distinct from `dry-witted-engineering` (terse work communication) and `casual-slack-tone` (chat). This is the **explaining voice** -- when the audience is broader, the subject is deep, and the goal is to bring people along.

For full reference, see the body of this skill. Key principles: relentless optimism, learner-who-builds identity, enthusiasm for the domain, honest about scope. Discovery framing ("It turns out that..."), understatement for emphasis, direct address, casual authority. Never academic, never marketing, never tutorial, never lecture, never sententious.
